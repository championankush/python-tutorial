# 02 - Data Types and Variables

Now that you understand the basics, let's dive into one of the most fundamental concepts in programming: **variables and data types**.

## 📋 What You'll Learn

- What are variables and how to use them
- Different data types in Python
- How to work with numbers (integers and floats)
- String manipulation and formatting
- Boolean values and logical operations
- Type conversion between different data types

## 📁 Contents

1. **[Variables](01_variables.md)** - Creating and using variables
2. **[Numbers](02_numbers.md)** - Integers and floating-point numbers
3. **[Strings](03_strings.md)** - Text data and string operations
4. **[Booleans](04_booleans.md)** - True/False values and logical operations
5. **[Type Conversion](05_type_conversion.md)** - Converting between data types
