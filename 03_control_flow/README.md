# 03 - Control Flow

Welcome to control flow! This section covers how to make decisions and repeat actions in your Python programs using conditional statements and loops.

## üìã What You'll Learn

- How to make decisions with `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- Using comparison operators and logical operators
- Different types of loops: `for` and `while`
- Control flow keywords: `break`, `continue`, and `pass`
- Nested conditions and loops
- Best practices for writing clean control flow

## üìÅ Contents

1. **[Conditional Statements](01_conditionals.md)** - Making decisions with if/elif/else
2. **[Comparison Operators](02_comparison_operators.md)** - Comparing values
3. **[Logical Operators](03_logical_operators.md)** - Combining conditions
4. **[For Loops](04_for_loops.md)** - Iterating over sequences
5. **[While Loops](05_while_loops.md)** - Repeating while conditions are true
6. **[Loop Control](06_loop_control.md)** - Break, continue, and pass
7. **[Nested Control Flow](07_nested_control.md)** - Complex decision making

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Write conditional statements to make decisions
- Use comparison and logical operators effectively
