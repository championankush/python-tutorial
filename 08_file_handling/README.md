# 08 - File Handling

Welcome to file handling! This section covers how to read from and write to files, a crucial skill for data processing and application development.

## 📋 What You'll Learn

- **File Operations**: Opening, reading, writing, and closing files
- **File Modes**: Different ways to access files (read, write, append)
- **Text vs Binary Files**: Working with different file types
- **File Paths**: Understanding absolute and relative paths
- **Error Handling**: Managing file operations safely
- **Context Managers**: Using `with` statements for automatic cleanup
- **File System Operations**: Creating, moving, and deleting files
- **CSV and JSON Files**: Working with structured data formats
