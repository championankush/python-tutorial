# 05 - Data Structures

Welcome to data structures! This section covers the fundamental ways to organize and store data in Python using lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.

## 📋 What You'll Learn

- **Lists**: Ordered, mutable collections of items
- **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable collections of items
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs for mapping data
- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique elements
- **List comprehensions**: Elegant ways to create lists
- **Nested data structures**: Complex data organization
- **Common operations and methods** for each structure
- **When to use each data structure** for optimal performance
