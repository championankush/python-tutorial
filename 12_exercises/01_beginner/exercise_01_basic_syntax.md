# Exercise 1: Basic Python Syntax

## üìã Objective
Practice basic Python syntax, variables, data types, and simple operations.

## üéØ Learning Goals
- Understand Python variable assignment
- Work with different data types
- Perform basic arithmetic operations
- Use string formatting
- Practice basic input/output

## üìù Problem Statement

Create a Python script that performs the following tasks:

### Part 1: Variable Assignment and Data Types
1. Create variables for the following:
   - Your name (string)
   - Your age (integer)
   - Your height in meters (float)
   - Whether you like Python (boolean)
   - A list of your favorite programming languages
   - A dictionary with your contact information (name, email, phone)

2. Print each variable with a descriptive message.

### Part 2: Basic Operations
1. Calculate and display:
   - Your age in months
   - Your height in centimeters
   - Your age in 5 years
   - Your height in feet (1 meter = 3.28084 feet)

### Part 3: String Operations
1. Create a formatted string that introduces yourself using all the information above
2. Use different string formatting methods (f-strings, .format(), % formatting)
3. Create a multi-line string with your programming goals

### Part 4: User Input
1. Ask the user for their favorite number
2. Ask the user for their favorite color
3. Create a sentence using their inputs
4. Validate that the number input is actually a number

### Part 5: Simple Calculations
1. Create a simple calculator that:
   - Takes two numbers as input
   - Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
   - Handles division by zero
   - Displays results in a formatted way

## üîß Requirements

### Code Structure
```python
# Your code should be organized like this:

# Part 1: Variables and Data Types
# [Your code here]

# Part 2: Basic Operations
# [Your code here]

# Part 3: String Operations
# [Your code here]

# Part 4: User Input
# [Your code here]

# Part 5: Simple Calculator
# [Your code here]
```

### Output Format
Your program should produce clear, formatted output like:
```
=== Personal Information ===
Name: John Doe
Age: 25
Height: 1.75 meters
Likes Python: True
Favorite Languages: ['Python', 'JavaScript', 'Java']

=== Calculations ===
Age in months: 300
Height in cm: 175.0
Age in 5 years: 30
Height in feet: 5.74

=== Introduction ===
Hello! My name is John Doe. I am 25 years old and 1.75 meters tall.
I love Python and my favorite programming languages are Python, JavaScript, and Java.

=== User Input ===
Please enter your favorite number: 42
Please enter your favorite color: blue
Your favorite number is 42 and your favorite color is blue!

=== Calculator ===
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
10 + 5 = 15
10 - 5 = 5
10 * 5 = 50
10 / 5 = 2.0
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- [ ] All variables are properly defined with appropriate data types
- [ ] Calculations are accurate and well-formatted
- [ ] String formatting uses multiple methods
- [ ] User input is properly handled and validated
- [ ] Calculator handles all operations including division by zero
- [ ] Code is well-commented and organized
- [ ] Output is clear and user-friendly

## üöÄ Bonus Challenges

1. **Enhanced Calculator**: Add more operations (power, modulo, floor division)
2. **Data Validation**: Add more robust input validation
3. **Personal Touch**: Add more personal information and calculations
4. **Error Handling**: Add try-except blocks for better error handling
5. **Formatting**: Make the output more visually appealing with separators and colors

## üí° Hints

- Use `input()` function to get user input
- Remember that `input()` returns a string, so convert to numbers when needed
- Use `try-except` blocks to handle invalid input
- Use `round()` function to limit decimal places
- Use `len()` function to get the length of lists and strings
