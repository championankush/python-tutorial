# 06 - Modules

Welcome to modules! This section covers how to organize your code into reusable modules and packages, making your programs more modular and maintainable.

## 📋 What You'll Learn

- How to import and use existing modules
- Creating your own modules and packages
- Understanding the Python module system
- Using built-in modules (math, random, datetime, etc.)
- Package management and organization
- Module search paths and imports
- Best practices for module design
- Virtual environments and dependencies
