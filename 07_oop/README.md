# 07 - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Welcome to Object-Oriented Programming! This section covers how to create classes and objects, the foundation of modern software development.

## 📋 What You'll Learn

- **Classes and Objects**: Creating blueprints and instances
- **Attributes and Methods**: Data and behavior of objects
- **Inheritance**: Creating hierarchical relationships
- **Encapsulation**: Data hiding and access control
- **Polymorphism**: Different forms of the same interface
- **Magic Methods**: Special methods for object behavior
- **Class vs Static Methods**: Different types of methods
- **Design Patterns**: Common OOP solutions

## 📁 Contents

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Create classes and instantiate objects
- Define attributes and methods for objects
- Implement inheritance and polymorphism
